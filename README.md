<h1>Fall</h1>

This is a JavaScript-based browser game where leaves and rocks fall from the sky, and the player collects points by clicking quickly. Leaves give +1 point, while rocks subtract -5 points. The game automatically becomes harder after every 15 points, increasing the falling speed, and the highest score is stored in localStorage. The visual effects: the leaves naturally sway, while the sticks fall straight, plus animated score feedback is displayed for each click.
